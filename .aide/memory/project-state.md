# FacMan Project State

Generated from `release/index/project_status.v2.toml`, the workspace lock,
the command/refusal registries, capability policy, and support matrix.
Edit canonical inputs, then run `py -3 tools/project_state.py --write`.

Tracked revision fields describe the reviewed checkpoint and retain their
v1 compatibility names. They do not claim to be the live checkout HEAD.
Generate that fail-closed observation after checkout with
`tools/current_checkout_observation.py`.

## Current product truth

- phase: `repository_slug_decision_01` / `current_slug_retention_task_candidate_active`;
- charter: Create any number of independent Factorio setups, select one, and launch the normal game as though it had always been installed and configured exactly that way.
- persona: A Factorio player who wants multiple complete, isolated game environments without rebuilding versions, mods, profiles, accounts, or settings by hand.
- golden journey: `find Factorio -> select/create instance -> choose version/preset/profiles/modpack/accounts -> inspect readiness -> prepare if needed -> Play to menu -> start/load/join/edit -> exit -> preserve state -> relaunch`;
- checkpoint: `facman-technical-preview-checkpoint-01`;
- active WorkUnit: `FACMAN-REPOSITORY-SLUG-DECISION-01`;
- next dependency-ready WorkUnit: `FACMAN-REPOSITORY-SLUG-DECISION-01`;
- next authority gate: `windows-technical-preview-candidate`;
- truth scope: `technical_preview_checkpoint_promoted_and_dev_synchronized_slug_retention_task_candidate_non_authorizing`; canonical main promotion: `true`; local counts promoted: `true`;

- execution: `unavailable` / `repository_slug_decision_non_authorizing_no_product_execution_authority`;
- Safe beta: `false`;
- release: `unpublished` / `not_proven_unsigned`.

## Readiness dimensions

- playability: `not_yet_playable`;
- user workflow: `candidate_qualification_waits_on_repository_slug_decision_acceptance`;
- safety authority: `all_real_execution_setup_release_and_publication_authority_closed`;
- platform support: `windows_first_alpha_planned`;
- release authenticity: `not_proven_unsigned`;
- compatibility: `experimental_public_subset`;
- user validation: `not_started`;

## Execution guarantees

- `instance_isolated`: product mode `accepted`, claim `unproven`, next gate `FACMAN-WINDOWS-INSTANCE-ISOLATED-PLAY-CANDIDATE-01`. The exact FacMan-owned instance closure is writable; protected software roots remain immutable; enumerated OS, driver, or platform state may change only after explicit disclosure.
- `hermetic`: product mode `accepted`, claim `unproven`, next gate `FACMAN-HERMETIC-PLAY-SANDBOX-POLICY-01`. An enforced isolation boundary prevents persistent change outside the authorised FacMan workspace.

## Instance product programme

- status: `gate2_read_only_projection_complete`;
- active WorkUnit: `FACMAN-INSTANCE-SPEC-AND-READINESS-01`;
- next WorkUnit: `FACMAN-OPERATION-PERMIT-01`;
- portable record: `InstanceSpec`;

- secondary save/world WorkUnit: `FACMAN-WORLD-BUNDLE-AND-SAVE-COMPATIBILITY-01`;
- runtime authority: `false`;

## Operation-permit programme

- status: `gate3_infrastructure_complete_no_issuance`;
- WorkUnit: `FACMAN-OPERATION-PERMIT-01`;
- authority model: `short_lived_plan_bound_exact_resource_permit`;
- provider revalidation required: `true`;
- permit issuance authority: `false`;

## Host-environment programme

- status: `planned_parallel_support_lane`;
- next WorkUnit: `HOST-ENVIRONMENT-CONTRACT-SPINE-01`;
- first runtime scope: `workflow_specific_read_only_list_inspect_doctor`;
- first apply WorkUnit: `WINDOWS-SANDBOX-PROFILE-01`;
- installation-model-v2 reviewed, committed, and clean: `true`;
- blocks real Play: `false`;
- host mutation authority: `false`;
- privileged broker authority: `false`;
- prerequisite: the current convergence, execution-foundation, and installation-model-v2 tree must be reviewed, committed, and reproduced cleanly.

## Capability snapshot

- available: `install.discover, install.model.inspect, install.reconciliation.plan, install.reference.register, launch.preflight, launch.preview`;
- conditional: `install.managed.plan, process.execute`;
- backlog: `install.existing.adoption.plan, install.existing.inspect`;
- unavailable: `credential.factorio.read, install.existing.adoption.apply, install.managed.apply, launch.execute.hermetic, launch.execute.instance_isolated, network.mod_portal.read, network.mod_portal.write, release.publish, release.sign`;

## Historical proof boundary

- completed technical wave: `m2`;
- last closed WorkUnit: `FACMAN-WINDOWS-EXISTING-INSTALL-JOURNEY-01`;
- accepted FacMan integration: `b745ca094a6701b4aa98c999f8913dab02a307ae`;
- historical Steam-backed H1 candidate/result: `eb629caaec9d62536a272336e940c0d3003fdaae` / `Fail`;
- Universal Launcher / Setup pins: `5479939ca5cbc9ee0f901608a92012778b4752ae` / `d2a2aae7e61c47035c92334b0522143b4fea3880`;
- M2 synthetic managed-target result: `MachinePass`;
- M3 disposition: `authorized_backlog_after_playable_alpha`; adoption apply remains `false`.

Historical M1/M2 details remain in `release/index/project_status.v2.toml`,
`.aide/history/`, and `docs/release/checkpoints/`. They do not select current
work or promote execution, network, credential, signing, or publication authority.

## Contract and validation identity

- commands / registered routes: `127` / `125`;
- schemas / refusal codes: `356` / `244`;
- command catalog digest: `a5e22f4a47a60efd0ef5867b0bf6dedb201fb660ef0e5d3b301250ef4c956e49`;
- accepted historical CI revision: `2f13923a9cbdd60d47cab114ba1e280282259bb5`;
- accepted historical matrix: `35` native and `337` Python tests.

## Quarantined capabilities

- launch.execute.instance_isolated
- launch.execute.hermetic
- process.execute
- install.managed.apply outside newly created, explicitly selected, policy-approved managed targets
- install.existing.adoption.apply
- network.mod_portal.read
- network.mod_portal.write
- credential.factorio.read
- release.sign
- release.publish

## Known blockers

- Installation model v2 and deterministic reconciliation planning are complete read-only; authenticated source inspection and transaction-backed lifecycle apply remain unavailable.
- Official Factorio Windows installers share uninstall registration identities; installing an older version can supersede the current 2.1 Add/Remove Programs registration even when program directories are separate.
- PR #169 promoted the exact b864bf0 Technical Preview checkpoint to main at 06496ed; PR #173 synchronized that ancestry back into dev at b745ca0 without changing the source tree.
- The repository-slug decision is an active task candidate: factorio-launcher remains the live GitHub slug, while facman is deferred pending beta naming and legal-clearance evidence.
- The 29 required Technical Preview rows must be re-evaluated against the exact accepted source after the repository-slug decision integrates.
- Factorio 2.1.14 is selected only for isolated engineering evidence; no release route, clean-host release receipt, or current human route verdict exists.
- The provisional application mark passes deterministic mechanical checks but still lacks small-size, trademark/public-brand, High Contrast, DPI, screen-reader, keyboard, terminology, and navigation judgments.
- AppKit has provisional native bundle runtime and frontend-only package proof on macos-15-intel, but the exact supported legacy toolchain, deployment-floor host, VoiceOver, full product closure, signing, and publication remain unproven.
- Artifacts remain unsigned, unpublished, unsupported, and noncanonical until the release factory, SBOM/provenance, signing or approved-unsigned policy, and explicit publication authority are complete.
