# FacMan Project State

Generated from `release/index/project_status.v2.toml`, the workspace lock,
the command/refusal registries, capability policy, and support matrix.
Edit canonical inputs, then run `py -3 tools/project_state.py --write`.

Tracked revision fields describe the reviewed checkpoint and retain their
v1 compatibility names. They do not claim to be the live checkout HEAD.
Generate that fail-closed observation after checkout with
`tools/current_checkout_observation.py`.

## Current product truth

- phase: `facman_4_0_0_final_distribution` / `f100_through_f210_qualified_final_distribution_validation_active`;
- charter: Create any number of independent Factorio setups, select one, and launch the normal game as though it had always been installed and configured exactly that way.
- persona: A Factorio player who wants multiple complete, isolated game environments without rebuilding versions, mods, profiles, accounts, or settings by hand.
- golden journey: `find Factorio -> select/create instance -> choose version/preset/profiles/modpack/accounts -> inspect readiness -> prepare if needed -> Play to menu -> start/load/join/edit -> exit -> preserve state -> relaunch`;
- checkpoint: `facman-2-1-14-route-permit-enforcement-01`;

## Readiness dimensions

- playability: `not_evaluated_no_gameplay_executed`;
- user workflow: `typed_frontend_v2_and_f100_f210_qualified_distribution_closeout`;
- safety authority: `no_current_route_authorization_fresh_d3_d4_required_after_final_integration`;
- platform support: `windows_x64_final_distribution_support_unclaimed`;
- release authenticity: `not_proven_unsigned`;
- compatibility: `experimental_public_subset`;
- user validation: `not_started`;

## Execution guarantees

- `instance_isolated`: product mode `accepted`, claim `unproven`, next gate `FACMAN-WINDOWS-INSTANCE-ISOLATED-PLAY-CANDIDATE-01`. The exact FacMan-owned instance closure is writable; protected software roots remain immutable; enumerated OS, driver, or platform state may change only after explicit disclosure.
- `hermetic`: product mode `accepted`, claim `unproven`, next gate `FACMAN-HERMETIC-PLAY-SANDBOX-POLICY-01`. An enforced isolation boundary prevents persistent change outside the authorised FacMan workspace.

## Instance product programme

- status: `gate2_read_only_projection_complete`;
- active WorkUnit: `FACMAN-INSTANCE-SPEC-AND-READINESS-01`;
- next WorkUnit: `FACMAN-OPERATION-PERMIT-01`;
- portable record: `InstanceSpec`;

- account bindings: `PlatformAccountBinding, FactorioAccountBinding, PlayerIdentityProfile, ServerCredentialBinding`;
- secondary save/world WorkUnit: `FACMAN-WORLD-BUNDLE-AND-SAVE-COMPATIBILITY-01`;
- runtime authority: `false`;

## Operation-permit programme

- status: `gate3_infrastructure_complete_no_issuance`;
- WorkUnit: `FACMAN-OPERATION-PERMIT-01`;
- authority model: `short_lived_plan_bound_exact_resource_permit`;
- provider revalidation required: `true`;
- permit issuance authority: `false`;

## Host-environment programme

- status: `planned_parallel_support_lane`;
- next WorkUnit: `HOST-ENVIRONMENT-CONTRACT-SPINE-01`;
- first runtime scope: `workflow_specific_read_only_list_inspect_doctor`;
- first apply WorkUnit: `WINDOWS-SANDBOX-PROFILE-01`;
- installation-model-v2 reviewed, committed, and clean: `true`;
- blocks real Play: `false`;
- host mutation authority: `false`;
- privileged broker authority: `false`;
- prerequisite: the current convergence, execution-foundation, and installation-model-v2 tree must be reviewed, committed, and reproduced cleanly.

## Capability snapshot

- available: `install.discover, install.model.inspect, install.reconciliation.plan, install.reference.register, launch.preflight, launch.preview`;
- conditional: `install.managed.plan, process.execute`;
- backlog: `install.existing.adoption.plan, install.existing.inspect`;
- unavailable: `credential.factorio.read, install.existing.adoption.apply, install.managed.apply, launch.execute.hermetic, launch.execute.instance_isolated, network.mod_portal.read, network.mod_portal.write, release.publish, release.sign`;

## Historical proof boundary

- completed technical wave: `m2`;
- last closed WorkUnit: `FACMAN-FRONTEND-SESSION-TYPED-V2-01`;
- accepted FacMan integration: `e73d778173be283d47925fa055ba1aae7b82fb28`;
- historical Steam-backed H1 candidate/result: `eb629caaec9d62536a272336e940c0d3003fdaae` / `Fail`;
- Universal Launcher / Setup pins: `5479939ca5cbc9ee0f901608a92012778b4752ae` / `d2a2aae7e61c47035c92334b0522143b4fea3880`;
- M2 synthetic managed-target result: `MachinePass`;
- M3 disposition: `authorized_backlog_after_playable_alpha`; adoption apply remains `false`.

Historical M1/M2 details remain in `release/index/project_status.v2.toml`,
`.aide/history/`, and `docs/release/checkpoints/`. They do not select current
work or promote execution, network, credential, signing, or publication authority.

## Contract and validation identity

- commands / registered routes: `127` / `125`;
- schemas / refusal codes: `382` / `244`;
- command catalog digest: `a99eb7db3a0524fafb04a620fc784040a7f877ba6ba0f0972f01cc8a903d2c01`;
- accepted historical CI revision: `2f13923a9cbdd60d47cab114ba1e280282259bb5`;
- accepted historical matrix: `35` native and `337` Python tests.

## Quarantined capabilities

- launch.execute.instance_isolated
- launch.execute.hermetic
- process.execute
- install.managed.apply outside newly created, explicitly selected, policy-approved managed targets
- install.existing.adoption.apply
- network.mod_portal.read
- network.mod_portal.write
- credential.factorio.read
- release.sign
- release.publish

## Known blockers

- Technical Preview product implementation is complete for all 29 frozen user outcomes, with zero ordinary CLI, TUI, or WinForms projection gaps.
- Exact alpha.1 source 8362ddc5 and hosted package 95d5836e pass three-root reconstruction, SBOM, provenance, licence, intact verification, and drift-refusal proof.
- No accepted real Factorio Play route exists; non-authorizing v4 is exact-green but awaits normal protected integration, final combined-tree rebinding, and fresh D3/D4 authorization. Every earlier authorization is expired and unusable.
- The WinForms and TUI human packet remains Inconclusive and gates beta rather than alpha publication.
- The alpha remains unsupported and may be unsigned only when that limitation is explicit; tag creation, publication, signing, support promotion, and route promotion remain unauthorized.
